- ### Reinforcement
    - Policy Optimization (PPO)
    - Q - Learning

###  Deep Learning:
- includes the following specific components:
    - ### Layers:

        - Conv2D (Convolutional Layer)

        - Dense (Fully Connected Layer)

        - Dropout

        - Flatten

        - Maxpool2D (Max Pooling Layer)

    - ### Loss Functions:

        - Crossentropy

        - MSE (Mean Squared Error)

    - ### Optimizers:

        - Adam

        - Momentum

        - RMSprop

        - SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)

Additionally, there appears to be a `Sequential` module, which likely represents a Sequential model API for stacking layers.



## 2. Philosophy

MelonLearn is designed with a focus on:

- **From-Scratch Implementation**: Algorithms are built from the ground up to provide deep understanding.  
- **Extensibility**: Modular design makes it easy to add new models or enhance existing ones.  
- **Experimentation**: Flexible framework to test algorithms and tune hyperparameters.  
- **Educational Value**: Ideal for students, researchers, and developers who want to learn the core concepts of ML and DL.



## 3. Getting Started

To clone and start using MelonLearn:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohamedelsayed0001/MelonLearn.git

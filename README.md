##  Features

### Machine Learning:

###  Deep Learning:
- includes the following specific components:
    - ### Layers:

        - Conv2D (Convolutional Layer)

        - Dense (Fully Connected Layer)

        - Dropout

        - Flatten

        - Maxpool2D (Max Pooling Layer)

    - ### Loss Functions:

        - Crossentropy

        - MSE (Mean Squared Error)

    - ### Optimizers:

        - Adam

        - Momentum

        - RMSprop

        - SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)

Additionally, there appears to be a `Sequential` module, which likely represents a Sequential model API for stacking layers.
